It is my pleasure to announce the fourth year of the C++Now Student/Volunteer program! We are again inviting students with an interest in C++ to attend the May 9-14, 2016 conference in Aspen, CO as Student/Volunteers.

<br />

The Student/Volunteer program is an excellent way for students and young coders with an interest in C++ to learn about language and make lasting connections with the community.

<br />

*"Attending has truly been one of the most inspirational moments of my life. I had the opportunity to learn, socialize and have a great time in general. I hope to attend this conference yearly now and make a lasting impact in the computer science community."* - [Grant Mercer, 2013 Student/Volunteer - read more](/2013_volunteer_story_mercer/)

<br />

Student/Volunteers will receive free registration and a travel stipend for their hotel and airfare.

<br />

Volunteers will handle various tasks during the conference, such as assisting presenters, setting up presentation rooms, running A/V equipment and helping with the conference picnic.

<br />

Students from all fields of study are welcome to apply. However, this conference covers advanced C++ topics, and applicants should have ample experience with the C++ programming language and be familiar with general computer science topics.

<br />

Applications will be accepted until March 16th, 2016.

<br />

Application decisions will be sent out by March 21st, 2016.

<br />

You can apply and/or learn more about the program and some of the students who have participated **[here](/student_volunteer_application/)**.

The <a href="/program-2016/">C++Now 2016 program</a> is now online.

<!--more-->

This year's Call for Submissions resulted in a record number of submissions, so it is no surprise that we've completely filled all three tracks for this year's conference.

We have sessions from <a href="/speakers-2016/">dozens of speakers</a>. Many sessions feature returning speakers, including our keynote speaker, Sean Parent, but many sessions are from speakers presenting at C++Now for the first time.

As expected, the program features many sessions on C++14, performance, metaprogramming, and concurrency. In addition, we have sessions on open source, Boost, tools, portability, maintainability, refactoring, functional programming, coroutines, games, testing, documentation, reflection, and, of course, what to expect in C++17.

Our tenth annual conference is shaping up to be one of the strongest programs that we've ever offered. <a href="https://cppnow2016.eventbrite.com">Join us in Aspen this May</a>.

The conference hotel is the Aspen Meadows Resort. This Bauhaus-inspired resort lies on 40 acres overlooking the Roaring Fork River. Surrounded by bike paths, walking trails, and mountain views, the resort is home to the Aspen Institute, an international nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering dialogue on global concerns. Hotel amenities include a health club that offers a range of workout equipment, a half-court gym, steam rooms, and an outdoor pool and spa tub. Complimentary wireless Internet access is provided throughout the resort. A business center provides complimentary services such as computer use, scanning, copying, and printing.

<br />

The Aspen Meadows Resort is approximately a block from the Aspen Center for Physics and ten blocks from downtown Aspen. Many visitors find it a very pleasant walk, but the resort also runs a complimentary shuttle into town daily.

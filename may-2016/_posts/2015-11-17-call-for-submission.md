### Call for Submissions
We invite you to submit session proposals to the 5th annual C++Now Conference (tenth annual BoostCon): C++Now 2015 (Aspen CO, USA, May 9 – 14, 2016).

Building upon the resounding success of previous BoostCon and C++Now conferences, C++Now 2016 will present leading speakers from the whole C++ community.

The C++Now Conference is dedicated to discussion and education about C++, an open and free language and standard.  Our Conference will focus on discussion and education about open source software usage and developments in the C++ developer and user community. To reflect the breadth of the C++ and Boost communities, the conference includes sessions aimed at three constituencies: C++ and Boost end-users, hard-core library and tool developers, and researchers pushing the boundaries of computation. The program fosters interaction and engagement within and across those groups, with an emphasis on discussion.

As a multi-paradigm language, C++ is a melting pot with the most compelling ideas from other programming communities blending in powerful ways. Historically, some of the most popular sessions at C++Now have highlighted these concepts, from DSLs to functional programming to transactional memory and more.  Bring your C#, Python, Ruby or Haskell influences to bear in an environment that will broaden their exposure.

At C++Now 2016 we would like to focus on the now established C++11 and C++14 standards and how those standards shape C++’s future. However, by no means is this intended to restrict the topics of proposals we hope to see. Any other topic related to C++, as described below, is suitable for submission.

####Important Dates
Proposal submissions due: December 20th, 2015 
Proposal decisions sent: February 15th, 2016 
Program online: March 7th, 2016

####Best Presentation Awards
We know how much effort it takes to prepare talks for our conference. For this reason attendees vote on the best presentations of the conference. Each winner will receive a commemorative plaque and announcement on the C++Now website.

####Session Topics
Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the following
C++11/14 and how it changes life for users and library writers 
New directions and proposal for upcoming C++ standards 
Concepts and generic programming 
Designing for testability 
Using specific Boost libraries in-depth 
Extending or enhancing existing Boost libraries 
Advanced implementation techniques used within Boost libraries 
The design and/or the development process 
Software development tools and their application to C++ and or Boost 
Boost infrastructure topics such as build tools, website, testing 
Any other topics likely to be of great interest to C++ developers 
Tools for better developer productivity

Interactive and collaborative sessions are encouraged, as this is the style of learning and participation that has proven most successful at such events. Sessions can be tutorial based, with an emphasis on interaction and participant involvement, or workshop based, whether hands-on programming or paper-based, discussion-driven collaborative work.

####Session Formats
Lectures focus on a practitioner’s ideas and experience with anything relevant to the C++ community.

Panels feature three or four people presenting their ideas and experiences relating to C++’s relevant, controversial, emerging, or unresolved issues. Panels may be conducted in several ways, such as comparative, analytic, or historic.

Tutorials are sessions at which instructors teach conference participants specific skills or knowledge relevant to C++.

Workshops provide an active arena for advancements in C++-relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest and experience.

Tool Vendor Presentations: We actively encourage tool vendors and ISP’s to submit proposals for a special Tool Vendors Session Track aimed at products related to Boost and C++ (compilers, libraries, tools, etc.).

Other formats may also be of interest. Don’t hold back a proposal just because it doesn’t fit into a pigeonhole.

####Submitting a Proposal
All submissions should be made through our submission page:  .

Standard sessions are 90 minutes. You may submit a proposal for fractions or multiples of 90-minutes. Fractional proposals will be grouped into 90 minute sessions. Longer sessions, such as tutorials and classes, will be assigned 90 minute, three hour (i.e. half day), or six hour (i.e. full day) time slots.

One registration fee is waived for a standard session presentation. Shorter sessions are prorated.

All submissions will go through a peer review process.

C++Now is held in-cooperation with ACM and all accepted proposals will be made available in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library (approval pending). The best papers, after further reviews, will be considered to be book chapters or journal articles in a renowned journal.

Session materials will be posted to the C++Now website and will be available to conference attendees.

For general information on the C++Now 2016 paper submission process or the scope of technical papers solicited, please refer to the conference website at cppnow.org. For any other questions about the submission process or paper format, please contact the Program Committee <mailto:cppnow2016@easychair.com> .

Note: Presenters must agree to grant a non-exclusive perpetual license to publish submitted materials, either electronically or in print, in any media related to C++Now.

C++Now is presented by Boost in-cooperation with ACM.

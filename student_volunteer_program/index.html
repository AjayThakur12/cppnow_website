<h3>Student/Volunteer Program</h3>

<br />

<p> The C++Now Student/Volunteer program was started in 2013 in an effort to encourage student involvement in the C++Now conference and the C++ community. Each year, the conference helps a small group of young programmers attend the conference. In exchange, the students help the C++Now staff in running the conference. Volunteers assist with various on-site tasks, such as recording sessions, escorting keynote speakers and setting up the conference picnic. They are able to attend most sessions. Volunteers receive a waiver of their registration fees and stipends for travel-related expenses are provided. </p>

<br />

<p><b>Applications will be accepted from through March 16th, 2016. Application decisions will be sent out on March 21st, 2016.</b></p>
